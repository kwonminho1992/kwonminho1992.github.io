### The Effect of Google Keep
Are you busy almost everyday? Are you anxious of your too many works? It is a good time to check you organize your works well or not. Maybe, you have heard about to do list. It is an efficient tool to recognize which works you need to do or don't need to do. <br>
You can use Google Keep as to do list for free. You need to prepare only Google account. That's all. By Google Keep, you can enhance your productivity at least 10 times. Furthermore, you are going to work less than before.


### How to Use Google Keep?
First, you need to login to your Google account. And then click Google Keep button like below.<br>

Click Edit labels button and create labels - Bucket list, Daily To do list, Old Daily to do list. <br>

If you created the labels successfully, the labels are going to be appeared like below.<br>

Now, we will create note on Daily To do list. Enter Daily To do list label and click the red box I've drawn<br>

Type 'Dump to do list' into Title. And then insert your works you need to do or will do in the near future, but not today. For example, if you need to go hospital 3 days later, you can insert 'Jan. 23, 2023 11:00~13:00 Go to hospital'. However, if you will meet a friend today, you do not insert. The screenshot below is an example. <br>

You can add works into Dump to do list note anytime when you have works.<br><br>
Next, you create daily to do list note on Daily To do list label. Type today's date into Title. And then insert your today's works. (you can refer Dump Daily to do list note.) You'd better organize today's to do list at the morning before you start to work. Of course, you can add works in the middle of today if additional works occur. When you complete one work, you can check the work to notify that you complete it.<br>

This is an example of daily to do list note. If the works have specific time, you write like '06:30~07:30 exercise', '14:00~15:00 meeting with Mike'.
If not, you just need to set priority for the works. In the example, you need to complete in order of top, medium, low. But, top1, top2, top3, low1, low2... is also possible. In this case, you can do flexibly between top1~3...<br>
As time goes, too many daily to do list notes are going to be piled up. So, you'd better change old notes to Old Daily To to list label.<br><br>
Bucket list label is additional. If you have long-term dreams like marathon, traveling Amazon etc.., you can note them to remember easily.<br><br>
